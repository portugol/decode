Alg_60
Create an algorithm that asks for the difference and the value of the first term then prints the tenth term of an arithmetic progression.

Alg_61
Create an algorithm that asks for the difference and the value of the first term then prints the fifth term of a geometric progression.

Alg_64
Create an algorithm that reads a temperature in Celcius and converts it to Fahrenheit. The formula used in the conversion is: F = (9.C+160)/5 where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celcius.

Alg_67
Create an algorithm that calculates the value of an overdue installment, using the formula:
installment = value + (value* (rate/100)*time).

Alg_69
Create an algorithm that that reads the numerator and the denominator of a fraction and prints it as a decimal number.

Alg_77_v1
Create an algorithm that reads two real numbers and prints the difference between the first and second value.

Alg_77_v2
Create an algorithm that reads two real numbers and prints the difference of squares of those numbers.

Alg_78
Given a convex polygon with n sides, we can calculate the number of different diagonals (nd) of that polygon using the formula: nd = n (n-3) / 2. Create an algorithm that that reads how many sides a polygon has then calculate and print the number of different diagonals (nd) it has.
