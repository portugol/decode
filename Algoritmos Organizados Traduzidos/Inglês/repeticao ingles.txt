Create an algorithm that prints the sum of all integers in a range inserted by the user.


Paulo Simões

2
Create an algorithm that allows the user to insert his or hers birth month. The algorithm can only finish if the month is valid (between 1 and 12).

3
A user requests for the execution of the algorithm “weather station” and types the number corresponding the chosen station. The algorithm only continues when the chosen option is valid (between 1 and 5).

4
Create an algorithm that prints all odd numbers from 1 to 100.

6
Create an algorithm that asks for a number then prints if it is a triangular number.

7
Create an algorithm that simulates a countdown of 10 minutes, in other words, prints 10:00, 9:59, 9:58, ..., 9:00; 8:59, 8:58... until 0:00.

8
Develop an algorithm that calculates the value of N from the following mathematical expression:

11
Given a country A with 5.000.000 inhabitants and a yearly birthrate of 3%, and a country B with 7.000.000 inhabitants and a yearly birthrate of 2%, calculate and print the amount of time required for the population of country A  to surpass the population of country B.
